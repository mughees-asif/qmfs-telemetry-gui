## Telemetry System for [Queen Mary Formula Student](https://www.qmformulastudent.co.uk/)

## Made using the [Medusa](https://github.com/HanSolo/Medusa) library

### Set-up for [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows):

1. From the main menu, choose VCS | Get from Version Control, or, if no project is currently opened, click Get from Version Control on the Welcome screen.

2. In the Get from Version Control dialog, specify the URL: 

	````
	https://github.com/mughees-asif/qmfs-telemetry-gui 
	````
3. Test to make sure that connection to the remote can be established, or select one of the VCS hosting services on the left. If you are already logged in to the selected hosting service, completion will suggest the list of available repositories that you can clone.

3. Click Clone. If you want to create a IntelliJ IDEA project based on the sources you have cloned, click Yes in the confirmation dialog. Git root mapping will be automatically set to the project root directory.

4. Download Medusa [JAR file](https://jar-download.com/artifact-search/Medusa).

5. Add to project structure and run.

6. The GUI is currently running on a random number generator function. To connect your own incoming data stream, use this [example](https://mkyong.com/java/how-to-read-and-parse-csv-file-in-java/) to see how to parse the CSV format.

7. The GUI logs all the parameters every second in the root folder as `output.txt`.

8. [Customise](https://community.oracle.com/docs/DOC-992746) as needed and [export](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/packaging-javafx-applications.html) to windows as an executable file.

9. Drop my [GitHub](https://github.com/mughees-asif) in the README.md :+1:.
